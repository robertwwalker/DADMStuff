## Bond Funds

Let us first load libraries and the tidyverse.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
Bonds <- read.csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertwwalker/DADMStuff/master/BondFunds.csv"))
```

## Markdown has many options

I will not explore them here.  The key thing is that I now have data and libraries.  If I want to use any more, I will have to call them and make sure that I call them before I use them.  Think of the markdown as a robot.

# Adding Graphs

Insert a chunk [Code > Insert chunk].  The [slides](https://rww.science/xaringan/flipbookgg/index.html) all reference *Bonds* and my graphics must too.

```{r}
ggplot(Bonds, aes(x=Risk)) + geom_bar()
```
